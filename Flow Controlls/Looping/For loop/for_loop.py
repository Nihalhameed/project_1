#For loop:


 #  If the increment is by 1 then no need to mention it in for loop as its default
 #  Upper limit condition works to print the output in the principle of 'upper-1'

#Syntax :
#Print Hello 10 times:

 #Note:
#1 is lower limit & 11 is upper limit ,where the loop works for upperlimit to get value upto 10 i.e UPPER-1

for i in range(1,11): #Here 'i' is for initialization #i= 1,2,.......10
    print("Hello")
